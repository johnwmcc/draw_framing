#c:/r/draw_framing/draw_framing_main.rb
Change log

Still to do/planned changes:
When creating new framing component, check to see if same size one exists already and use same definition
Tidy up Status Prompts and VCB messages and UserText input to make sense for frame drawing (they still mostly refer to CLineTool original)
Keystrokes Tab and Shift+Tab to cycle forward/backward through timber sizes


Planned changes made:
Keystrokes cursor/arrow keys Left, Right, Up, Down to toggle lock/unlock of drawing axis (but not orientation) DONE in v0.55
Add ability to choose additional Custom sizes and Actual not nominal sizes - DONE in v0.54
If possible, make it single undo to remove not only component drawn by PushPull but also original face and edges drawn at origin if operation cancelled before final PushPull DONE in v0.52



## v0.58 started 2014-11-29 11:10 PM
## Began using GitHub for source control

## v0.57 started 2014-11-25 10:18 AM
## Attempting to draw geometry and create geometry around face.normal 
##   if first click is on NON-orthogonal face

## v0.56 2014-11-25 10:15 AM
## Orient long axis vector parallel to face.normal 
##   if first pick is on an orthogonal face

## v0.55 - started on 2014-11-24
## Implemented keyboard choice of axis (using standard SU keys) to toggle axis constraint on/off:
##   red = Right Arrow, blue = Up or Down Arrow, green = Left Arrow
## and constrained mouse moves to orientation around selected axis
## Attempting to:
## Implement keyboard choice of orientation of cross section of timber, 
##   using Tab key to cycle through options - postponed this one

## v0.54 2014-17-04
## Moved sub-menu from Plugins to Draw, and renamed it Timber Frame
## Added standard size 5" x 1" or 125mm x 25mm and moved Custom size index from 11 to 12 accordingly
## Changed custom default size to 1/2" x 3/4" or 12.5mm x 19mm
## Changed custom size to mean actual not nominal size, since all usual standard sizes are now covered

## v0.53 2012-12-13
## Clean up redundant comments, and more redundant code from original clinetool
## Slightly amend face creation code to draw face at origin, then move it to pick point, so the 
## resulting component will have its axes at a corner of the first face drawn.
## Start trying to embody the pushpull length creation into the tool, not leave it as a separate operation 

## v0.52 2012-12-10
## Changed menu to read @n_size array directly instead of setting @c_menu
## Finally fixed errors resulting from cancelling Custom size data entry 
## - put in a test to check that 'results' are not nil before reading width and depth variables

## v0.51 2012-12-08
## Added choice of imperial or metric units, depending on model units
## Still has some errors using Custom sizes but mostly works ok

## v0.5 2012-12-08
## Changed custom size input box to expect a Length value, not a Float, 
##  and set standard imperial sizes to lengths as well
## Fixed the effect of Cancelling entry into Custom Size inputbox - now cleans up properly
## Chosen custom size now shows 'Custom ' before size 

## v0.493 2012-12-06
## Changed draw_geometry colours for long axis of component to show red, green or blue
## depending on orientation of principal axis

## v0.492 2012-12-06
## Removed some leftovers from cline_tool original code no longer relevant

## v0.491 2012-12-05
## Trying to remove leftovers from cline_tool original code no longer relevant

## v0.49 2012-12-05
## Tidying up bugs in remembering custom sizes, and in initiating standard nominal sizes
## v0.481 2012-12-05
## Fixed several bugs in setting Custom R-click menu, drawing Custom size timber; moved some startup settings to Initialize section instead of Activate section

2012-12-12-05 v0.49
Attempting to tidy up and remove remnant parts of cline_tool.rb coding that draw different styles of dotted/dashed line with or without start points. Left working version 0.481 as fallback

2012-12-12-05 v0.48x
After breaking things, realised that I was not loading the current version, and reverted to using the version in the C:\r\ folder. 

2012-12-02 v0.47
After long gap I lost the plot here and started editing version in Sketchup Plugins folder, while still loading /r/ version. Couldn't understand why changes weren't apparently 'sticking'.

2012-05-25 v0.46
Added ability to choose (and remember) one Custom size (nominal)

2012-05-10 v0.45
Prefixed new component definition with size (not just static text '2x1' previously used for testing).
Can't yet see how to get it to include length in component name
Added popup inputbox to set (one) Custom size - but it doesn't remember it for next frame element drawn and repeats custom size popup indefinitely.

2012-05-08 v0.44 
Create component definition name only if unique: check new component against existing ones - tried and failed to do this, and made file unusable
Reverted to v0.43

2012-05-07 v0.43
Moved timber size setup into 'activate' method
Added context menu to select timber size

2012-05-06 v0.42
Now works for non-orthogonal planes 
Added range of standard UK timber sizes, selectable by Class variable @@size_index
Added text at cursor to show size being drawn as [width,depth] using float variables


2012-05-05 v0.41
Got cross-section and drawn component to draw at pick point
Added cmd icons and cursor image
