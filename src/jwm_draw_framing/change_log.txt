Change log

Still to do/planned changes:
Separate out profile at origin (@profile_points) from final drawn profile (profile_points_final)  translated to pick point, so when creating profile, it can be drawn as a component at the origin, then translated to pick point and will have aligned axes. [Mostly done, but not quite right yet for swapped rotation]

When creating new framing component, check to see if same size one exists already and use same definition.

Use variant of CLineTool to control a Ruby pushpull instead of invoking PushPull Tool. Should be fairly easy now I can see how to do it. [Done, without the full visual feedback though]

Tidy up Status Prompts and VCB messages and UserText input to make sense for frame drawing (a few still refer to CLineTool original).

Keystroke Tab to cycle forward through timber orientation (and maybe Shift+Tab to go backwards?) - to flip cross section left-right, top-bottom, or both, or back to original.

Minor glitches still to fix:
- @face is left drawn if component name input box is cancelled

## v0.7.6.5
Now works usably - UserText input now works to set length
Still to fix: 
- inferencing for @ip3
- orientation on top of group with aligned axes not parallel to sides (may not be fixable)

## v0.7.6.4
Few very minor tweaks. Changed profile to rectangular
Now is usable BUT:
- Orientation with mouse moves in reverse sometimes when it shouldn't
- UserText input for component length isn't setting length
- Inferencing for @ip3 isn't working - does it need to be moved into draw method, not draw_geometry?

## v0.7.6.3
Draws rectangular profiles. But Axis Lock still doesn't work well or reliably. Then when trying to fix that, found that the draw_geometry stopped working for @state = 2.

Disabled self.reset(view) after first mouse click, in onLButtonDown - now draws the geometry again. But doesn't create it. Saved this version as next starting point

## v0.7.6.2
Derived from 0.7.4 to try to fix problems in drawing rectangular profiles - have not got back to a working draw_geometry showing outline of component that will be created.

Create geometry not quite working yet - draws profile, but not finished component.

Orientation not correct when drawn on solid group top surface - not parallel to edges

Flip still not working. 

Still haven't even looked at axis lock not working to fix on correct axis - the profile is not drawn normal to the axis, though the axis itself is locked in the right direction.

## v0.7.4.0
Skipped v0.7.3 (all scrambled - deleted it), went to this version to start try to fix axis lock not working properly which I noticed wasn't right in 0.7.0 that I thought WAS ok for all main functions.

## v0.7.2.5
Starting branch to help debug flip which just isn't working


## 0.7.2.2
Simplified version to try to debug why my transforms are changing BOTH original and shift/rotated copy of  @profile_pointsH.

Stripped out most code after draw_geometry that for the moment just draws profile at origin.

Not even working properly but shows  @profile_pointsV AND  @profile_pointsH both changing as you move the mouse around the pick point - V is orange 3px wide, H is black 1px wide.

## v.0.7.0
Finally fixed difference between reported Face.normal and geometric direction of @long_axis, by introducing a new variable @apparent_normal, and using it JUST to calculate where to display long axis in draw_geometry for @state == 1 and 2. For reasons I don't understand, using the (wrong) face.normal still draws the face profile_points array in the right plane, rotating about the wrong @long_axis.

Needed to distinguish cases of 1. Face in a ComponentInstance, 2. Face in a group, and 3. 'Loose' geometry face. 

Found and fixed minor loose ends
-  finish creating component didn't deselect @face 
Still to fix
- cancel component naming still leaves @face drawn and doesn't clear drawn (feedback) geometry


## v0.6.3.3
Thought I had it all fixed and working, then discovered an anomaly in the way Face.normal works. If picked face is part of a (closed) rotated component, Face.normal doesn't take account of component rotation, just the direction of the normal to the picked face BEFORE rotation. Furthermore, when I correct the @long_axis vector to get it to point in the correct (geometrical) direction, this threw off the (previously working) calculation of @vec5 - normal to Z_AXIS and face normal. Took hours to work out how to compensate for this. 

Had to revert to v0.6.3.1 and go forward from there

## v0.6.3.2
Fixed mis-alignment of drawn and created cross-sections

## v0.6.3.1
Reversed rotation in draw_geometry, so profile follows mouse direction, when viewing up the @long_axis. Calculated angle between view.camera.direction and @long_axis - need to reverse rotation if angle is < 90 degrees. 

Could improve by starting drawing in correct quadrant, but it is usable at the moment.

Found later that the cross-section on a reversed face is created 90 degrees round from drawn section. Need to fix in later version.

## v0.6.3.0
Fixed misalignment (rotated orientation) of created component, which now is created where drawn, and changed PAR profile back to rectangular. But now find that face normal and drawn line to set component length aren't in same direction when face is angled.

## v0.6.2.1
Fixed non-aligned bounding box. Now create cross-section geometry at origin first, as a ComponentDefinition instead of a Group/ComponentInstance. Then insert an instance of the definition at the origin, and transform it into correct orientation and position, instead of drawing it directly at the @first_pick point.

Doesn't yet handle swap orientation of cross-section - still to fix.

Fixed extrusion going in wrong direction if @face.normal and @long_axis point in opposite directions.

Attempted and didn't quite succeed in getting TAB key to flip cross-section orientation in X, Y, or both. Try again next version - most of the pieces are there, just have to work out where better to make the change and/or how to do it both in draw and create geometry.

## v0.6.2.0
Fixed an extra 90 rotation of drawn geometry after second click (by introducing @quad variable), so now profile cross-section goes where the last magenta image is drawn

Started work on keeping the PushPull on cross-section face within this tool. Draws a vector along the long axis, which inferences to appropriate points, and calculates length along @long_axis.0

## v0.6.1.2
Changed code to back off @quadrant from if..else..end to use modulus 4.

Fixed uninitialized @profile_points0 - now defined as empty array in activate.

Removed unnecessary clone (copy) actions.

Went too far, to a non-working state, and had to back off a lot of changes. This version (many changes undone) works, but still has wrong component origins, and misaligned bounding box for angled components.

## v0.6.1.1
Finally got orientation of cross section to work without jittering by changing tack in how to do it.
Now use combination of mirror along X_AXIS and reducing @quadrant rotation count by one.

## v0.6.1.0
Made some mistake that crashed Sketchup without bug splat or Ruby error message.
Reverted to v0.6.0.9 and started over on getting rotation and orientation to work without jitter.

## v6.0.9
Orients cross-section according to mouse position (not very smoothly or reliably though), and draws geometry in the same place, then calls PushPull Tool to finish extrusion.



Planned changes made:
Keystrokes cursor/arrow keys Left, Right, Up, Down to toggle lock/unlock of drawing axis (but not orientation) DONE in v0.55
Add ability to choose additional Custom sizes and Actual not nominal sizes - DONE in v0.54
If possible, make it single undo to remove not only component drawn by PushPull but also original face and edges drawn at origin if operation cancelled before final PushPull DONE in v0.52

## v0.6.0.7
## error when first pick is not on a face - one of the vectors and/or transforms is not initialised properly. FIXED
## face angle is wrong if you pick on a back face - reverts to Z_AXIS. WRONG: it was seeing a transparent horizontal face in front (the base of an inverted dome), and actually working correctly!
## draw_geometry should 'pin' the drawn geometry at the first pick point, then use mouse move to then orient cross section before create_geometry is called on second pick or (after dragging) onLButtonUp

## v0.6 to v0.6.0.6
## Changed from defining cross section as only rectangular, to using an arbitrary string of points to define a profile. Set up transformations to rotate and orient draw_geometry polyline to align to face if first click is on a face, or a face in a component, or in the x-y plane if click is not on a face but empty space. Stepwise addition of functions to draw long axis of timber, and the normal to it about which rotation brings the drawn shape onto the plane of a picked face. Added cursor key sensing to toggle axis lock on X, Y, or A axes before drawing.

## v0.6 Restarted from scratch with barest bones of line tool code.

## v0.58 started 2014-11-29 11:10 PM
## Began using GitHub for source control

## v0.57 started 2014-11-25 10:18 AM
## Attempting to draw geometry and create geometry around face.normal 
##   if first click is on NON-orthogonal face. Made substantial progress, then it all went wrong!

## v0.56 2014-11-25 10:15 AM
## Orient long axis vector parallel to face.normal 
##   if first pick is on an orthogonal face

## v0.55 - started on 2014-11-24
## Implemented keyboard choice of axis (using standard SU keys) to toggle axis constraint on/off:
##   red = Right Arrow, blue = Up or Down Arrow, green = Left Arrow
## and constrained mouse moves to orientation around selected axis
## Attempting to:
## Implement keyboard choice of orientation of cross section of timber, 
##   using Tab key to cycle through options - postponed this one

## v0.54 2014-17-04
## Moved sub-menu from Plugins to Draw, and renamed it Timber Frame
## Added standard size 5" x 1" or 125mm x 25mm and moved Custom size index from 11 to 12 accordingly
## Changed custom default size to 1/2" x 3/4" or 12.5mm x 19mm
## Changed custom size to mean actual not nominal size, since all usual standard sizes are now covered

## v0.53 2012-12-13
## Clean up redundant comments, and more redundant code from original clinetool
## Slightly amend face creation code to draw face at origin, then move it to pick point, so the 
## resulting component will have its axes at a corner of the first face drawn.
## Start trying to embody the pushpull length creation into the tool, not leave it as a separate operation 

## v0.52 2012-12-10
## Changed menu to read @n_size array directly instead of setting @c_menu
## Finally fixed errors resulting from cancelling Custom size data entry 
## - put in a test to check that 'results' are not nil before reading width and depth variables

## v0.51 2012-12-08
## Added choice of imperial or metric units, depending on model units
## Still has some errors using Custom sizes but mostly works ok

## v0.5 2012-12-08
## Changed custom size input box to expect a Length value, not a Float, 
##  and set standard imperial sizes to lengths as well
## Fixed the effect of Cancelling entry into Custom Size inputbox - now cleans up properly
## Chosen custom size now shows 'Custom ' before size 

## v0.493 2012-12-06

## Trying to remove leftovers from cline_tool original code no longer relevant

## v0.49 2012-12-05
## Tidying up bugs in remembering custom sizes, and in initiating standard nominal sizes
## v0.481 2012-12-05
## Fixed several bugs in setting Custom R-click menu, drawing Custom size timber; moved some startup settings to Initialize section instead of Activate section

2012-12-12-05 v0.49
Attempting to tidy up and remove remnant parts of cline_tool.rb coding that draw different styles of dotted/dashed line with or without start points. Left working version 0.481 as fallback

2012-12-12-05 v0.48x
After breaking things, realised that I was not loading the current version, and reverted to using the version in the C:\r\ folder. 

2012-12-02 v0.47
After long gap I lost the plot here and started editing version in Sketchup Plugins folder, while still loading /r/ version. Couldn't understand why changes weren't apparently 'sticking'.

2012-05-25 v0.46
Added ability to choose (and remember) one Custom size (nominal)

2012-05-10 v0.45
Prefixed new component definition with size (not just static text '2x1' previously used for testing).
Can't yet see how to get it to include length in component name
Added popup inputbox to set (one) Custom size - but it doesn't remember it for next frame element drawn and repeats custom size popup indefinitely.

2012-05-08 v0.44 
Create component definition name only if unique: check new component against existing ones - tried and failed to do this, and made file unusable
Reverted to v0.43

2012-05-07 v0.43
Moved timber size setup into 'activate' method
Added context menu to select timber size

2012-05-06 v0.42
Now works for non-orthogonal planes 
Added range of standard UK timber sizes, selectable by Class variable @@size_index
Added text at cursor to show size being drawn as [width,depth] using float variables


2012-05-05 v0.41
Got cross-section and drawn component to draw at pick point
Added cmd icons and cursor image
